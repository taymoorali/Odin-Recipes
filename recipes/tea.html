    <h1>What is Chai Tea?</h1>
    <img src="../recipes/images/tea.jpg"  alt="tea"; height="250"; width="350">
    <p>The pale tea that North Americans typically drink is nothing close to the tea drunk by millions of Pakistanis.<br>Pakistani tea, called <b>chai</b> in Urdu, is rich and milky, deeply coloured, steaming hot, and boldly flavourful with a definite need for sugar to offset the toasty bitterness. The word chai just means tea. <br>Chai = tea.</p>
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Water</li>
                <li>Milk</li>
                <li>Lots of tea leaves or tea bags for strong infusion</li>
                <li>Plenty of sugar</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Recipe</h3>
            <ol start="1">
                <li>Bring <b>water, milk and spices</b> to a simmer in a small saucepan on the stove (adding the spices from the start gives them plenty of time to infuse).</li>
                <li>Reduce heat and add in <b>black</b> tea to brew.</li> 
                <li>Wait for tea to <b>steep</b> (do not boil it at this point or the tea releases too many tannins â€“ those bitter compounds that make your mouth feel dry).</li>
                <li><b>Strain</b> the warm spiced mixture into a mug; this will hold back the whole spices and tea leaves.</li>
                <li>Stir <b>sugar</b> into your chai and sweeten to taste. Enjoy!</li>
